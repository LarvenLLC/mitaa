# CONTENT

**This directory is not required, you can delete it if you don't want to use it.**

Empower your NuxtJS application with the @nuxt/content module: write in a content/ directory and fetch your Markdown, JSON, YAML and CSV files through a MongoDB-like API, acting as a Git-based Headless CMS.

Creating a file in this directory automatically activates the option in the framework.

More information about the usage of this directory in [the documentation](https://content.nuxtjs.org/).
